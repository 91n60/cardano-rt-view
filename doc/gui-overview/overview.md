# GUI Overview

RTView displays nodes' metrics on the web-page. And there are two view modes for this page:

1. Pane mode;
2. Grid mode.

You can select the mode from the dropdown list at the top bar of the page.

Pane mode shows all the metrics received from a particular node inside a panel. So if you have three nodes that forward their metrics to RTView, you will see three panels. Pane mode is more compact; it is suitable if you open the page on a mobile device.

Grid mode displays the table where columns correspond to the nodes, and rows correspond to the metrics. So if you have three nodes, you will see the table with three columns. Grid mode is more useful if you want to compare the same metric(s) received from the different nodes: they will be shown side-by-side in the columns.
