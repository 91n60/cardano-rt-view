********************************************
RTView: real-time watching for Cardano nodes
********************************************

What is it
==========

RTView is an application that allows seeing the state of running `Cardano nodes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/>`_ in real-time.

Who is this for
===============

RTView is useful for anyone who runs Cardano nodes and wants to see what is going on. You can view the information about the nodes, peers, blockchain, transactions, resources, etc.

Key features
============

1. **Cross-platform**: you can use it on Windows, Linux, or macOS.
2. **Multiple nodes**: connect as many nodes as you want, whether they run locally or on different machines.
3. **Web-based UI**: it provides configurable sections, live charts, and interactive tooltips. Use any browser or run RTView behind a web server like NGINX and view your nodes' state on any third-party device.

How it looks like
=================

The default view mode looks like this:
