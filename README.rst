********************************************
RTView: real-time watching for Cardano nodes
********************************************

RTView is a program that allows seeing the state of running `Cardano nodes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/>`_ in real-time.

Key Features
============

1. **Cross-platform**: there are pre-built packages for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
2. **Multiple nodes**: RTView can simultaneously receive the metrics from many nodes, whether they run locally or on different physical machines.
3. **Web-based UI**: it provides configurable sections, live charts, and interactive tooltips. Additionally, if RTView runs behind a configured web server, it can be accessed by any third-party devices.
